  			<h1>New planets discovered</h1>
  			<h5>Posted 23 February 2017</h5>

  			<p>

  			NASA has discovered seven (!) Earth-like planets in a solar system called Trappist-1, only 39 lightyears away from us. It is only a matter of time before the aliens living there discover that we have been spying on them, but hopefully they will be forgiving.<br>

  			But if it does comes to war, better prepare yourselves because it seems as if the leader of the free world
  			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrkJM4JUB28">is not ready</a> for an attack of that scale.<br>

  			NASA will soon be launching an expedition to Trappist-1 and tickets will soon be released on their website so that you can join too!<br>

  			Here's a preview of what the tour might look like: <img src="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/system/resources/detail_files/2159_posternormalsize.jpg" alt="poster" width="500px">
